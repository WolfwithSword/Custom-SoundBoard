# Custom-SoundBoard
A simple, custom soundboard with hotkeys (10 Global, infinite local). Used initially as an excuse for me to learn C#

New in V1.0.1:

	-Global Hotkeys

	You can now set up to 10 global hotkeys which work with any window in focus. They are Alt+(0-9).
	
	A new Stop global hotkey is Alt+E.
	
	For local hotkeys which can be infinite in number, it is CTRL+###, using number row.
	
	'Local' hotkeys are for when the soundboard window is in focus. Both global and local work when in local.
	The difference is global keys use ALT and have a finite number, local keys use CTRL and are infinite.

This soundboard can add technically infinite number of buttons and soundclips.

With having so many sounds, you can scroll through the list, or use a hotkey generated by the sound number (eg one sound is Ctrl+1, 15th is Ctrl+15 etc). These hotkeys are local-only, as in, they will only work while the soundboard is active and is the foreground window. This does not apply to global hotkeys.

If you attempt a hotkey and it doesn't exist, it will do the next full-applicable number. Ex If you have 15 sounds and do Ctrl+111, it will play the 1st sound, as it will do the 11th then immediately the 1st sound, canceling the 11th.


Sound buttons can have custom names and images as well to help with identification. There is a context menu on right-click to modify existing buttons.
