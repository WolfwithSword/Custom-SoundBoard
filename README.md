This soundboard can add technically infinite number of buttons and soundclips.
With having so many sounds, you can scroll through the list, or use a hotkey generated by the sound number (eg one sound is Ctrl+1, 15th is Ctrl+15m etc).

Sound buttons can have custom names and images as well to help with identification. There is a context menu on right-click to modify existing buttons.

On hover, a tooltip will appear displaying the full text in case it is too long to display or obscured by an image

You can choose the playback device to be any active, enabled playback device on your system. It will auto-update when clicked on.

And of course, simple audio control is available. 

To add new sounds, click the 'Add' button on the top left. To stop a currently playing sound, either hit the 'Stop' button, or Ctrl+E.
To remove buttons or edit the name/image/sound, right click the button and a context menu will appear.
