# Custom-SoundBoard
A simple, custom soundboard with hotkeys (10 Global, infinite local). Used initially as an excuse for me to learn C#

New in V1.0.1:
Global Hotkeys
	You can now set up to 10 global hotkeys which work with any window in focus. They are CTRL+(0-9).
	
	A new Stop global hotkey is CTRL+E.
	
	For local hotkeys which can be infinite in number, they are now using the numpad for the index number.
	
	'Local' hotkeys are for when the soundboard window is in focus. Both global and local work when in local.
	The difference is global keys use the number row 0-9, and local hotkeys use the numpad.

This soundboard can add technically infinite number of buttons and soundclips.
<<<<<<< HEAD
With having so many sounds, you can scroll through the list, or use a hotkey generated by the sound number (eg one sound is Ctrl+NumPad1, 15th is Ctrl+NumPad1+NumPad5 etc).

With having so many sounds, you can scroll through the list, or use a hotkey generated by the sound number (eg 1st sound is Ctrl+1, 15th is Ctrl+15, 192 is Ctrl+192 etc). If you attempt a hotkey and it doesn't exist, it will do the next full-applicable number. Ex If you have 15 sounds and do Ctrl+111, it will play the 1st sound, as it will do the 11th then immediately the 1st sound, canceling the 11th.

Sound buttons can have custom names and images as well to help with identification. There is a context menu on right-click to modify existing buttons.

You can choose the playback device to be any active, enabled playback device on your system. It will auto-update when clicked on.
